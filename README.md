- WebSocket (for real-time communication)
- Redis (for data storage)

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (version x.x.x or higher)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version x.x.x or higher)
- Git (optional, for version control)

## Setup Instructions
### Server Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url> && cd server`
2. Install necessary Go packages: `go mod tidy`
3. Configure environment variables (if any) in a `.env` file. You may need to include settings for MongoDB connection, server port, etc.
4. Start the server: `go run main.go`. The server will start running on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Client Setup
1. Navigate to the client directory: `cd client`
2. Install required Node.js packages: `npm install`
3. Start the client application: `npm start`. The client will start running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
Once both the server and client are running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application. You can register, log in, and start playing!
